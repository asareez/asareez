## Hi there 👋 I'm Fareez (a.k.a. Fareez Farid)

I'm a Computer Science student who’s passionate about turning ideas into real, working apps and games. Whether it's a productivity tool or a turn-based game with cute characters — I love imagining digital worlds and then building them, one line of code at a time. ✨

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:  
  A **gameified productivity app** where a cute companion levels up as you complete tasks — and even fights monsters when you're on top of your goals 💪🎮

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
  **Flutter** (for mobile app development) and improving my skills in **Java** and **Python** — I enjoy learning how real-world software comes to life

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:  
  Creative and meaningful projects — whether it’s small games, functional mobile apps, or tools that help people grow

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with:  
  Building habit systems (in code and in real life!), open source contribution, and getting started with publishing on Steam or Play Store 🚀

- 💬 Ask me about:  
  My journey as a student balancing studies, coding dreams, and running marathons 🏃‍♂️💻 — or just life in tech from a human-first perspective

- 📫 How to reach me:

- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  I love coding, playing the guitar, running long distances, and romanticizing the idea of growth — in code, body, and soul 🌱💖
  
📌 *More projects coming soon — currently working on something exciting!* 💻🌱
